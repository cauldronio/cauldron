# GitLab Boards

At Cauldron we use GitLab [boards](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/boards) to have at a glance all the issues planned for a sprint, the roadmap or the main topics.

## Roadmap

Each month, the Cauldron Team meets to review the [roadmap board](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/boards/1936822) status, to move features to closer term and, potentially, to propose new "features" for upcoming months. These "features" are tagged as as near-mid-long term depending on when we want to have them solved.

For the first ones, in `Near Term` tag, the development team splits them into `epics` for the upcoming sprints. And those `epics` are tagged according to the working area of Cauldron they are related to.

In the roadmap board we have made a division to see the issues grouped according to their deadline.

## Sprint

Every 15 days, the Cauldron team meets to plan the epics that will take place during the sprint, as well as the selection of issues from user feedback that will be carried out.

The current sprint board is denoted with a `>` symbol at the beginning of the board name, for example, `> Rice`. In the board we have made a division to see the issues grouped according to their status (doing, blocked, review).

## Topics

The issues in Cauldron may belong to one or more topics, that is, areas of working defined by the development team. In this [board](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/boards/1936881) we have made a division to group the issues according to their topic.
