# [Cauldron](https://cauldron.io)

Cauldron is a SaaS analytics solution developed by [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) that allows users to aggregate information from multiple collaboration platforms as different types of data sources. Cauldron is free, open source software to allow users, contributors, and maintainers to use, study, share, and improve the software openly.

Cauldron is based on the [GrimoireLab toolset](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab). All the software used to produce it is free / open source software.

### Issues labels.

**[TBD](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/issues/393)**

We have some tags that could be useful to filter the different classes of issues we have:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Theme](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/boards?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Theme) | Platform's features we plan to develop. |
| [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/boards?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Epic)  | Detailed tasks to solve a  `bug`  or a  `feature`. Epics are tasks that should be solved during a Sprint time. If a  `bug`  or a  `feature` is very specific and can be solved during a Sprint time, it doesn't need to be divided into several epics, and this label could be used added to it. |
| [Bug](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/boards?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=bug)   | For glitches found in the platform. |
| [TBD](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/issues/393) | - |



### Sprint management

1. Cauldron development is scheduled in Sprint time of 14 days each that ends with a [new release](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/tree/master/releases).
2. At the start of each Sprint, [Team Members](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/project_members) select (`epic` and (`bug` or `feature`)) labeled issues to work on them for the next release.
3. That epics are listed and updated in [the Sprint kanban](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/boards/994133?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Epic&milestone_title=%23started).
4. Team Members move the epics from left to right in the kanban to ensure things get done.
 

### Issues triage

1. Issues can be created by anyone, [Team Members](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/group_members) or the community (users, partners, anyone).
2. [Team Members](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/group_members) review the issue and tag it as bug or feature and assign it to a milestone.
3. If needed, [Team Members](https://gitlab.com/groups/cauldronio/-/group_members) will split into several epics.
4. Bugs will be solved ASAP. If possible, during following sprints.
5. Features will be added to the Roadamp (see below) to be solved as scheduled.
