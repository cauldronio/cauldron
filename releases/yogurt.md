At Cauldron we have started the new year with the launch of a release, Yogurt!

This new release has lasted considerably longer than the previous ones, as the Christmas holidays have kept the development team a bit busy. Just before the beginning of Christmas we wrote a small post about some of the features that we had developed in those few days, we leave it [here](https://community.cauldron.io/t/the-cauldron-before-christmas/100) for you to take a look.

Among these new features pre-Christmas are the possibility of exporting project data in CSV format, being able to compare up to 5 projects on the comparison page, or the launch of a new metrics section on a project page.

It's been a long time since we've released something like this, but a new data source has arrived at Cauldron, [GNOME's GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org). This new data source will allow users of this custom GitLab instance to analyze the projects that are there. Remember that in order to carry out the analysis of these repositories you will need an account there. In the following release we will include more data sources related with GitLab like KDE.

One of Cauldron's goals is that a user who once added an organization to analyze will not need to analyze again if new repositories have been added on GitHub or GitLab. To achieve this, we have taken a small step by storing some of the actions that a user performs, such as adding or removing a repository.

At Cauldron we have used several tools to analyze the use that users make of the platform, from Google Analytics to Matomo. After a while we have decided to switch to [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), a new GDPR-friendly open-source platform.

Lastly, we have modified some metrics and visualizations that we use in Cauldron, which had some bugs. Along with that, we have updated its documentation.

We hope you like these new features and that this new year brings many improvements to Cauldron, do not hesitate to request new features!
