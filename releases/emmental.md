The 5th release of Cauldron has arrived, and with it, the migrations of Django and ODFE to the versions 2.2 and 1.3, respectively.

Now, the admin site shows info about the users registered in the server (Number of projects, token status, etc). In addition, any admin can upgrade a user to an admin and vice versa.

We have updated the main public dashboard shown when you enter Kibana for the first time to make a more helpful homepage.

If you have tired of a project or created it by mistake, now you can delete it from the projects page and with it all its associated tasks

For the first time in Cauldron history, you can delete your account as all your projects and tokens stored in the server. This action can also be done by the admin users from the admin page.

Fixed a bug that did not allow to analyze Gitlab repositories when they were within a subgroup.

Some links that were previously scattered across the page have been placed in a new smart navigation button.

A status page has been included, from which it is displayed some info about the general status of the server (It is planned to add more functionality to this page). Plus, it is accessible without being logged.

We have deployed a Cauldron Forum! The forum is now in the growth phase, but it already has some support articles and user guides from Cauldron.
