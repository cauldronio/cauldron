This new release of Cauldron comes with some interesting changes to the project metrics and some other stuff.

We are continually improving the metrics and graphs of the project page, and in this new release we have included some new graphs and metrics to the community part that will allow you to obtain even more data on the evolution of your open-source projects.

We have updated some of the existing metrics, adding improvements and solving some bugs that you have reported to us.

We have updated the labels and boards that we use for development in Cauldron, and we thought that this information would be useful to you, so we have written a small guide about it, you can find it [here](https://community.cauldron.io/t/about-labels-and-boards/79).

We continue working on the task management system, we are already doing tests to see that everything works correctly, and we hope to have everything integrated soon.

With nothing more to tell, we hope that this new release will give you a better insight into your favorite projects. See you soon!
