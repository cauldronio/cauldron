In this new realease, [Hatstall](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-hatstall), a web interface for Sortinghat for managing identities, is one of the most important features included in Cauldron. It is only accessible from a local or custom deployment. It allows to merge identities and associate them to organizations. For more information on how to create your own instance go to [deployment repository](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron-deployment).

Datatables is another important feature, it allows you to manage a big amount of repositories within a single table which make it easier to filter datasources and pagination. Repository list should be manually updated to avoid excessive workload.

In curry, there are new options when adding repositories to your project: you can select if you prefer issues and pull requests, commits, or both.

As requested by many people, when you add a datasource to your project list, and it was analyzed before, it is now refreshed.

Google Analytics is now an optional module that can be included in the deployment.

Logs are correctly visualized when you refresh a repository.
