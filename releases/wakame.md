Here we go with another release of Cauldron, Wakame!

In this new release we have been focused on improving both the back-end and the front-end.

One of the most remarkable things about this new version is the possibility of filtering the metrics and visualizations of a project by repository. You can select one, two, or the repositories you want and view only the data corresponding to the selected repositories. For the occasion, we have written a small post about this new feature, you can take a look [here](https://community.cauldron.io/t/incoming-feature-repository-filtering/94).

We continue to expand and improve the project comparison page. On this occasion, we have expanded the number of visualizations that are shown, and we have redistributed some of them across the different sections, so they make more sense.

The pool scheduler is working like a charm, and we've made some tweaks to make its performance even better. You surely notice it.

Finally, we have fixed some bugs that some of you have reported during these days.

That's all for now, we hope these new changes to Cauldron will further enhance your experience with the platform. We will have new features added shortly, such as new filtering options and new visualizations and metrics!

See you in the next release!
