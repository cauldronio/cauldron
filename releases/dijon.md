This release has been focused on creating a new user interface for the users.

The homepage has been updated. Now the user can know more about Cauldron before starting to analyze data. It includes some screenshots about what the user is going to see, the supported data sources and some popular dashboards.

The user's projects list has been moved to a new page (/projects). From that page, the user can view the gathering status, refresh the data sources and open Kibana. 

Users can now manage their tokens in a new settings page (/profile) and also can change their username from there.

Cauldron has now a newsletter!! (the position for the sign up has to change)

Cauldron is now available at [cauldron.io](https://cauldron.io) and the source code has migrated from gitlab.com/cauldron2 to gitlab.com/cauldronio.

We have made some updates in the panels, fixed some typos and updated another sections of HTML.
