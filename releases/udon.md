This new release of Cauldron comes with a few interface changes and other minor fixes.

The project page has been modified to group metrics and visualizations by category, as we previously had a sparse distribution. Now only the metrics and graphs that make any sense are shown, depending on the data sources you have chosen for your project. For example, if you have not requested to analyze issues and pull requests, the graphs corresponding to this type of data will not be displayed, since they would be empty.

To publicize this new layout, we have written a small post about it, take a look!

Finally, we have experienced a slight delay with the new task system, we are finalizing the details and hope to release it during the next release.

We hope that these small changes will make your experience with the platform a little easier!
