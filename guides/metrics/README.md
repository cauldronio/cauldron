# Project metrics

Each project in Cauldron provides some basic metrics about the repositories or other data that you may have analyzed.

These metric are divided in 2 categories, and an overview panel that includes metrics and charts from both sections.

Also, for those interested in further software development metrics, there is the possibility of viewing the results of your analysis in [Kibana](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/kibana/), through the `More details` button, found at the end of the sections.
