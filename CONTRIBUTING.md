# Contributing to Cauldron

:+1: :tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Cauldron. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a merge request.

## Code of Conduct

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Report unacceptable behavior to contact@cauldron.io.

## How to contribute

When contributing to this project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [issue](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron/-/issues/new), [community.cauldron.io](https://community.cauldron.io/c/support-feedback/2), or any other method with the owners of the project before making a change.

Cauldron members will answer to it as soon as possible and do the [issue triage](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron#issues-triage).


## Merge Request Process

1. If you want to contribute to the project, we recommend first to create a fork of the repository you want to modify. If it is a code component, it is probable that you need to deploy Cauldron using the [caulron-deployment repository](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron-deployment).
1. The changes should be made in your fork branch, and when submitting the merge request, select `Allow commits from members who can merge to the target branch`. That way we can review the changes with the latest version at anytime.
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Merge Request would represent.
1. You may merge the Merge Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
